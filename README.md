## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
A rectangle shape with an elevation of 8 mm on one half with a total of 5 holes. the biggest and middle being 25 mm and the 4 others being 10.

### Reflection

For a while I had a lot of issues with this because the holes arent symmetrical so I thought I was doing something wrong but when I matched up the rectangle and the square it worked.

## Fork

### Description
The third Onshape assingment was to make the fork. It has a circular base of 80 millimeters and two identical prongs.

### Reflection

This was difficult for me because of the introduction of the mirror tool but I think I have it figured out

### Reflection

This was one of the harder tasks so far. I had a lot of trouble getting the dimensions right but somehow did it.

## Wheel

### Description
A sort of I shape we used to revolve into the shape of a wheel

### Reflection

This one gave me a hard time since it was so complex. It was hard for me to figure out what was happening when you move the smart dimension below the line but eventually the dimensions came out right

### Reflection

This was easy for me because it was so quick and my new knowledge from doing the other parts.
