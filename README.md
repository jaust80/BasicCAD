## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Fork

### Description
The third Onshape assingment was to make the fork. It has a circular base of 80 millimeters and two identical prongs.

This was difficult for me because of the introduction of the mirror tool but I think I have it figured out

This was one of the harder tasks so far. I had a lot of trouble getting the dimensions right but somehow did it.

## Wheel

### Description
A sort of I shape we used to revolve into the shape of a wheel

This one gave me a hard time since it was so complex. It was hard for me to figure out what was happening when you move the smart dimension below the line but eventually the dimensions came out right
